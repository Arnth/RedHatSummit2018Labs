:numbered:

== Overview

Long description: In this lab we explore BPM REST API and 3Scale. Through the custom interface we trigger a release of a new BPM container and update 3Scale to reflect this new deployment.

. Goal

* Explore user interface
* See BPM's REST API in action
* Update 3Scale

=== Creating a new BPM container

We will first create a new BPM container through the user interface.

=== Update 3Scale

We will now add a rule in 3Scale to route traffic to the new container

=== Test API calls

We will now use the user interface or postman to explore the REST API

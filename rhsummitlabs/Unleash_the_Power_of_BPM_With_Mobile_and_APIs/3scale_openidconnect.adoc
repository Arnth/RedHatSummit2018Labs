== Introduction

In this lab you will integrate OpenID Connect into 3Scale. This gives you single sign on for both 3Scale and BPMS.

==== Lab Summary
. Step 0: Read me
. Step 1: Configure the 3Scale api to use the OpenID Connect Authentication method.
. Step 2: Edit the 3Scale api APIcast Configuration and set the OpenID Connect Issuer.
. Step 3: Set the Application API Credentials Redirect URL
. Step 4: Test using postman

== Step 0: Read me

3Scale will push Applications into Red Hat SSO. To do this we configure 3Scale to use a service account.

The credentials for this service account are:
Client ID: 3scale_sync
Client Secret: 38cd5c45-fee4-4735-ae89-33dfcfad480d

If you would like to know how this was done, refer to Appendix.

== Step 1: Configure the 3Scale api to use the OpenID Connect Authentication method.

. Open a browser and access the following URL: https://redhat-bpms-admin.3scale.net
. Enter your username and password.
. Select the relevant API from the list and click the Integration link.
. Click "edit integration settings" from the right hand corner.
. Scroll down the page until you get to the "Authentication" section.
. Select the OpenID Connect option.
. Click "Update Service"

== Step 2: Edit the 3Scale api APIcast Configuration and set the OpenID Connect Issuer.

. Select the relevant API from the list and click the Integration link.
. Click "edit integration settings" from the right hand corner.
. Click "edit APIcast configuration".
. Scroll down the page and enter the "OpenID Connect Issuer" url. This is the url of your Redhat SSO realm. Also, ensure the service account details are added.
 * https://3scale_sync:38cd5c45-fee4-4735-ae89-33dfcfad480d@auth-summit.tk:8443/auth/realms/summit
. Finally, click "Promote to Production".

== Step 3: Set the Application API Credentials Redirect URL

:NOTE At this stage any new Applications created for a Application plan linked to the OpenID backed API service will be synced into Red Hat SSO as a Client.

. Open a browser and access the following URL: https://redhat-bpms-admin.3scale.net
. Enter your username and password.
. Click on the "Developers" link and select the relevant developer.
. Click on the Applications link.
. Click "Create Application".
. Select the relevant "Application Plan" from the drop down list.
. Click "Create Application"
. The new application should now be displayed. Scroll down the page to the "API Credentials" section and set the "Redirect URL" value to "https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback".

NOTE: You will need the Client ID and Client Secret for step 4, under API Credentials.

== Step 4: Test the configuration using Postman

In this section we test the service via Postman

:NOTE We use the native Postman app not the google plugin. Steps change slightly on the google plugin but is very similar.

. Open postman and create a new request
. Click "Create Collection" and save your request
. Setup a GET request to your 3Scale staging or production url (if you have promoted to production) with the following subpath - kie-server/services/rest/server/containers
	.. for example https://test-2445582504254.staging.gw.apicast.io:443/kie-server/services/rest/server/containers
. In Authorization select OAuth 2.0
. Click Get New Access Token
. Enter the following
	.. Callback URL - https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback
	.. Auth URL - https://auth-summit.tk:8443/auth/realms/summit/protocol/openid-connect/auth
	.. Access Token URL - https://auth-summit.tk:8443/auth/realms/summit/protocol/openid-connect/token
	.. Client ID - `Application id from Step 3`
	.. Client Secret - `Application secret from Step 3`
. Click Request Token
. Login using your username and password 'abc123'
. Click Use Token
. Execute the Send request

== Appendix

=== Create 3Scale service account in the RH SSO realm.

This account will be used by 3Scale to perform client synchronisation.

. Open a browser and access the Redhat SSO Admin user inteface
. Select the relevant realm
. Create a new client by selecting the Clients menu item from the left side and click the Create button.
. Set the following values and click save:
    * Client Id : 3scale-admin
    * Client Protocol : OpenId-Connect
. On the client settings tab set the following values and click save:
    * Standard Flow Enabled = OFF
    * Direct Access Grants = Enabled
    * Service Accounts Enabled = On
. Click the Service Accounts tab that now should be visible. If it's not visible you may need to refresh the page.
. Click on the Client Roles drop down and select Realm Management from the list. A list of Available Roles should now appear.
. Select manage-clients and click Add Selected to move the role accross to the Assign Roles section. The role should also appear in the Effective Roles section.
. Click on the credentials tab and take a copy of the secret as this will be required shortly.
. Check that a user with the kieserver role exists within the realm. If one doesn't exist then you will need to follow the labs on how to configure Redhat SSO and Redhat BPMS.


:NOTE Currently a http request is used because the service account option is not exposed

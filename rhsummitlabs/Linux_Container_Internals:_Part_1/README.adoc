== Linux Container Internals - Part 1

:numbered:

== Overview

Description:

In this lab you'll gain a basic understanding of the moving parts that make up the typical container architecture. This will cover container hosts, daemons, runtimes, images, orchestration, etc.

. Goal

By the end of this lab you should be able to:

* Draw a diagram showing how the Linux kernel, services and daemons work together to create and deploy containers
* Internalize how the architecture of the kernel and supporting services affect security and performance
* Explain the API interactions of daemons and the host kernel to create isolated processes
* Command the nomenclature necessary to technically discuss container repositories, image layers, tags, registry server and other components

=== Environment

The demo environment is deployed using katacoda at https://katacoda.com/fatherlinux/courses/subsystems/container-internals-lab-1.

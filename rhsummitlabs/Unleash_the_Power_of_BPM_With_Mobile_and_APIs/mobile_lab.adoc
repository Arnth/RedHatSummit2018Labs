The project contains the following:

* *Cloud App FSI* - this is a server-side component written in NodeJs that calls the BPM API and also provides data synchronisation.
* *Bank Admin Portal* - this is a back-office web portal that demonstrates how a UI can be built on top of BPM Suite for managing live Tasks and Cases.
* *Consumer App xx* - this is a consumer facing mobile app that demonstrates how a customer can order products, which instantiate BPM processes.

. Open the file */lib/bpm/bpmCalls.js* and have a look at the API calls that are being made
. Click on *Environment Variables* on the left hand side
. Note the various BPM connection variables that have been specified. These can change per environment you deploy to.
. Click on *Data Browser* on the left hand side
. This gives you a view of the data that the cloud app has cached. Have a look at some of the data stored in the Cases and Tasks.
. Click on *Deploy* on the left hand side.
. This is where you can deploy new versions of the cloud app. Each time you do this a history record is generated.
. Click on *Logs* on the left hand side.

. Enter any username and click *Login*
. Have a look at the Dashboard, Case List and Task List pages to get an idea of what can be built using the BPM REST API.
. When you start playing with the customer mobile app and go through the process of ordering products you will see the new Cases and Tasks appear automatically in this portal.
